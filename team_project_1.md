# Team Project Part 1

## Description

In your assigned team of 4-5, you will collaboratively create a program to analyze data from an open-sourced dataset. 

For example, your team might wish to examine the relationship between the length of a movie and the ratings users give the movie on a popular website. Or you may wish to explore the relationship between the size of a dog breed and the associated genetic ailments of that breed. Teams are encouraged to pick a business case that interests you, is robust enough that you have flexibility to practice your skills, and that is well-suited for showcasing business impact.

The task in front of your team is deliberately open-ended. Your team will have to make decisions together:
* How will you make sure all team members can contribute to the project?
* How will you make decisions?
* What is the question you're trying to answer through your data analysis?
* What tasks need to be completed to get to your final output?

At the end of the module, all team members are encouraged to fork the repo onto their profile so that prospective employers can view the project. 

### Live Learning Content

The Technical Facilitator will deliver brief learning sessions on the following topics:

* How to communicate the value and impact of your work.
* Best practices when working in a team.
  
This project applies skills from the following previous modules:

* Introduction to Building Software (Git, Shell & Python) 
* Applying Statistical Concepts (Linear Regression, Classification, and Resampling) 

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of the Team Project 1 module, participants will be able to:
* Work through common problems or challenges a team encounters when collaborating using Git and GitHub, including merge conflicts.
* Understand your business case and dataset.
* Create a program to analyze a dataset with contributions from multiple team members.

## Instructions

1. You will be assigned a dataset. As a team you should explore the dataset and think about the questions listed below.

2. Create a new repository for your project (see the [README.md](https://github.com/UofT-DSI/team_project/blob/main/README.md) for a folder structure template you could use as a starting point).

3. Determine what roles the various team members will play on the team, which tasks need to be completed and assigned to which team members, and what your team standards will be with respect to code reviews, approvals and merges. 

4. Have fun! This project is yours. This is the time to create something that prospective employers can consider when reviewing your application for a role, so be sure to clearly demonstrate the business value that your project could provide. What will your project tell them about you, your skills and your ability to work effectively on a team?

Additionally, there are resources listed at the bottom of this page to help you understand Git conflicts and ways to work effectively as a team. You should review these to help set standards for your team processes.
  
### Questions to discuss when reviewing your dataset

* What are the key variables and attributes in your dataset?
* How can we explore the relationships between different variables?
* Are there any patterns or trends in the data that we can identify?
* Who is the intended audience for our data analysis?
* What is the question our analysis is trying to answer?
* Are there any specific libraries or frameworks that are well-suited to our project requirements?

## Requirements 

While there are no hard requirements for the end of the Team Project 1 module, you should think about the milestones you need to reach in Team Project 1 to set yourself up for success in Team Project 2. Specifcally, you should:

1. Thoroughly understand your data and the business case for your analysis. What will the impact of your results be?

2. Clean your data. Be confident in the decisions you have made while doing so (eg. default handling of NULL values).

3. Test out regression analyses. It may take several tries before you are satisfied with your results and understand how you can provide the most insight. Projects are usually iterative, so dedicate time to investigation!

4. Make sure your code is well commented and decisions are documented. When Team Project 2 starts, you should be able to jump right back into your project without relying on memory.

5. Keep your README up to date. Not only is that easier than writing it all at the end of your project, it will help keep you on track and ensure your alignment with your business objective.
