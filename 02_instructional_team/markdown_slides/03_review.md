# Review

* Last week, we focused on several key topics:

    1. How to present this project in your portfolio.
    2. How to effectively develop a business case for your project.
    3. How to investigate your dataset.
    4. How to distribute and track work as a team.
    5. How to demonstrate the business impact of your project.
    6. How to hold effective team standup meetings.

# Project Plan

* You have each received feedback on your Project Plan in the form of a GitHub issue. You should incorporate this feedback into your README this week.

* When submitting your final project, ensure that you have a section in the README for changes you have made to your original project plan.

# Final Project Submission

Your final project will be evaluated on the following criteria:

1. Each team member must have created a pull request, and reviewed and merged a different pull request.

2. (a) For **Data Science** teams, your project must include at least one visualization that presents new insights into the chosen dataset.

   (b) For **Machine Learning** teams, your project must include at least one machine learning model that you have developed and implemented to obtain new insights.

# Final Project Submission

3. In addition to the project proposal from Week 1, each project's README should describe the final outcome of the project, the key business takeaways, and describe your team's approach to working collaboratively. It should also demonstrate thoughtful consideration of the [guiding questions](#reviewing-your-dataset).

# Final Project Submission

4. Each team member must record a 3-5 minute video reflecting on your experience. You may each choose where to host your own video, however _it should be public and a link to each team member's video should be included in your project README_. This video is meant to be an asset to your portfolio, and should be available for prospective employers. Your videos should answer the following questions:
    * What did you learn?
    * What challenges did you face?
    * How did you overcome those challenges?
    * If you had more time, what would you add?
    * What strengths do you bring to a team environment?

# Keep in Mind

* **Good Code & Structure** → Code should be well-commented, clean, and follow a logical structure. It should be easy to read and maintain.
* **Strong Documentation & Presentation** → The README should be clear, well-written, and explain the dataset, findings, and methodology. The project should be easy to understand for both technical and non-technical reviewers.
* **Application of Module Teachings** → Projects should showcase key technical skills, such as regression modeling, deep learning models, data visualizations, or strong analysis of sampling techniques.
* **Effective Team Collaboration** → Teams should follow best practices for Git (small commits, branches, pull requests) and actively participate in stand-ups and progress updates.

# Standups

* Each day, a member of the DSI instructional team will guide your team through a standup.  
* Stand-ups are **quick, structured check-ins** that help teams stay on track and remove obstacles.  
* The goal is not to compete for who did the most work, it’s to ensure the entire team is working effectively and efficiently.  
* This is a great opportunity to help your teammates and **resolve blockers early**.  
* Standups should take no more than **10 minutes**.
