# Leveraging Project Management Methodologies

Explore methodologies like Scrum, Kanban, Waterfall, and Agile on your own. For now, let's focus on an essential concept: **spikes**.

**Spikes** are short, time-boxed research tasks designed to answer specific questions or solve particular problems before starting the main project work. They are designed to _reduce uncertainty_.

## [The Five Orders of Ignorance](https://www.5oi.org/the-five-orders-of-ignorance)

**A "meta-model of ignorance" that can help us put the unknowns of projects into context.**

0. Zeroth Order Ignorance (0OI): Lack of Ignorance
1. First Order Ignorance (1OI): Lack of Knowledge
2. Second Order Ignorance (2OI): Lack of Awareness
3. Third Order Ignorance (3OI): Lack of Process
4. Fourth Order Ignorance (4OI): Meta Ignorance

# Examples Across Sectors (Part 1)

### Healthcare Example
"***Improved patient outcomes*** by developing a predictive model using Python and scikit-learn. Data was preprocessed using pandas to handle missing values and standardize features. Logistic regression was selected through cross-validation due to its interpretability and performance."

### Retail Example
"***Optimized inventory management*** with SQL and Tableau. Data was cleaned and aggregated using SQL queries to identify sales patterns. Visualizations in Tableau helped to ***forecast demand, leading to cost savings of 5%."***

*‚è≠Ô∏è Continued on next slide...*

---

# Examples Across Sectors (Part 2)

### Marketing Example
***Increased customer engagement by 8%*** by performing customer segmentation using k-means clustering with Python. Feature engineering was conducted to create meaningful segments based on purchase history and demographics. The optimal number of clusters was determined using the elbow method, which helps identify the point where adding more clusters does not significantly improve the model.

---

# Demonstrating Technical and Business Skills

- **Demonstrate Coding Proficiency**: All projects should showcase your ability to write clean, efficient, and well-documented code.
- **Showcase Communication Skills**: All projects should effectively communicated complex data-driven insights to non-technical team members.

Your ability to document code clearly and communicate effectively can drastically reduce onboarding times for new team members and help non-technical stakeholders make informed decisions, thereby enhancing overall project success and team efficiency.

---

# Communicating & Presenting Your Findings

---
# Making Complex Concepts Accessible

Communicating complex data science concepts clearly is essential for audiences without technical backgrounds, **including recruiters and HR teams.**

Strategies to Enhance Understandability:
- **Use Analogies and Metaphors**: Bridge understanding gaps with relatable comparisons.
- **Incremental Explanation**: Simplify concepts step-by-step.
- **Visual Aids**: Employ diagrams and infographics for clarity.

Clear communication ensures your projects are comprehensible to all, enhancing your professional appeal and broadening project impact.

<!-- Speaker notes: Emphasize the need to make data science projects accessible to non-experts, including those in HR and recruitment. Discuss using analogies, incremental explanations, and visual aids to clarify complex ideas. This approach not only makes your work more impactful but also supports your candidacy during job evaluations. -->

---

# Example of Making Complex Concepts Accessible

### Remember the "Healthcare Example" above?

Before:
```
"Improved patient outcomes by developing a predictive model using Python and scikit-learn. Data was preprocessed using pandas 
to handle missing values and standardize features. Logistic regression was selected through cross-validation due to its 
interpretability and performance."
```
After:
```
‚ÄúImproved patient outcomes by developing a predictive model using Python and scikit-learn. Think of the predictive model as a way
to forecast patient health based on past data, much like predicting the weather. Data was preprocessed using pandas to handle
missing values and standardize features. This preprocessing is like organizing and cleaning up messy medical records to ensure all
information is complete and consistent. Logistic regression was selected through cross-validation due to its interpretability and
performance. Imagine trying  different medical treatments and choosing the one that consistently gives the best results; that‚Äôs 
what cross-validation does for model selection.‚Äù

```

This approach effectively communicates complex concepts to both technical and non-technical audiences, ensuring clarity and comprehension across diverse stakeholders.

---

# How to Effectively Communicate Business Impact

Showcase your project‚Äôs business value by applying specialized skills:

- **üìä Data Science Stream**: Apply the techniques learned in your sampling and visualization modules to deliver impactful data insights.
- **‚öôÔ∏è Machine Learning Stream**: Demonstrate model efficiency and algorithm optimization with detailed performance graphs and clear pipeline visualizations.

Ensure your presentations translate complex data into clear, actionable business insights.

<!-- Speaker notes: Encourage Data Science stream participants to apply their sampling and visualization techniques effectively. Machine Learning stream participants should focus on illustrating model efficiency and optimization. Emphasize that both groups need to communicate how their projects provide tangible business value to potential employers. -->

---

# Final Presentation & Feedback Session

- This day is for showcasing your progress on the project goals so far. It‚Äôs not about meeting all the requirements yet, but about presenting what your project is about, what you‚Äôve done, and what you plan to do next. It‚Äôs also a chance to get feedback and ideas from your fellow participants. 
- Each team has a maximum of 5 minutes to present. Put your best foot forward, as you may never get such a diverse audience of this size again. The audience is comprised of your fellow participants, who now have a good background in data science and machine learning, and have extensive expertise in their respective industries. They will serve as judges and provide valuable feedback.

---

# Next Steps Post-Certification

As you transition from the certificate, continue to build and showcase your skills.

### Strategies for Continuous Growth:

- **Active Portfolio**: Aim for 5-6 substantial projects to demonstrate a broad range of skills. Focus on quality over quantity.
- **Explore and Learn**: Continue exploring new areas within data science and machine learning to keep your knowledge current and dynamic.
- **Peer Collaboration**: Participate in group projects with fellow participants to enhance your skills and widen your professional network.

Actively applying for jobs should proceed in tandem with these activities.

<!-- Speaker notes: Emphasize that maintaining a portfolio with 5-6 diverse projects is ideal for demonstrating a commitment to the field and depth of skills. Clarify that the focus should be on the quality of projects rather than simply meeting a numerical target. Encourage participants to continuously apply for jobs, using their portfolios to strengthen their applications and showcase their ongoing engagement and expertise. Remind them that even after the modules end, they still have access to the Slack community (more information will come out later). This platform can be a valuable resource for finding project partners, asking questions, and getting feedback on their work. Additionally, advise them to present completed projects on LinkedIn. This not only timestamps their active engagement in relevant projects during job searches but also enhances their visibility and personal branding on a professional network. -->
