# Selecting Projects That Showcase Your Skills

Choosing the right projects for your portfolio is crucial. Each project should:

- **Solve Real Problems**: Use actual datasets to address genuine issues in your field. (*examples in the next slide*)
- **Demonstrate Industry Relevance**: Select projects that are pertinent to your specific area, such as marketing analytics for marketers or predictive maintenance for engineers.
- **Provide Actionable Insights**: Focus on projects that deliver clear, practical outcomes that demonstrate your ability to impact real-world scenarios.

These criteria ensure that your projects not only highlight your technical skills but also your understanding of and adaptability to industry-specific challenges, making you a valuable candidate to potential employers.

---

# Showcase Projects That Use Diverse Data Types

Enhance your projects by effectively using a mix of structured, unstructured, and time series data:

- **Structured Data**: Employ database data for clear, quantifiable insights.
- **Unstructured Data**: Add depth with text, images, or videos.
- **Time Series Data**: Utilize data in sequential order for trend analysis and forecasting.

Select data types strategically to align with your project's objectives. Ensure each type contributes to a clear and coherent narrative, avoiding unnecessary complexity to maintain focus and utility.

# Effective GitHub Repository Organization

- Ensure your GitHub repository is neatly organized; avoid unused or empty folders and ensure each folder has a clear purpose.
- Use READMEs in key folders (like `src`, `iac`, `backend`, `frontend`, etc.) to detail their contents and purpose, aiding clarity for complex sections.
- Avoid READMEs in simple folders (like `images`, `docs`, etc.), unless there's specific information that needs to be explained.

---

## Merge Conflicts

It is likely that you will encounter merge conflicts when combining your work as a team.
Make sure you've reviewed the Git material regarding how to resolve merge conflicts properly!

---

# Crafting a Comprehensive Main README File

- **Purpose & Overview:** Introduce the project with essential details, concise description and a project objective.
- **Goals & Objectives:** Articulate what the project aims to achieve.
- **Techniques & Technologies:** Highlight the tools and methods used.
- **Key Findings & Instructions:** Summarize outcomes and provide setup instructions.
- **Visuals & Credits:** Enhance with visuals; acknowledge contributors.

<!-- 
Focus on the essence of what makes a README effective: clarity and conciseness. A well-organized README provides a snapshot of the project, helping others quickly understand its value and how to engage with it. Ensure that each element is presented in a way that contributes to an overall understanding of the project.
-->

# Writing Clear Documentation (README & Comments)

While **you can have multiple README files** in your repository, include only one README file per folder to keep things clean and simple. This structure showcases your ability to manage and present complex information effectively, increasing your appeal to potential employers.

**Effective commenting enhances code readability and maintainability, crucial for collaborative environments.**

If someone with no tech background reads your code, they should get the essence of what you are doing and how the code flows. This practice not only aids in understanding but also facilitates smoother transitions and updates within team projects.

## Example

‚ùå
```
function calculateTotal(price, quantity) {
    return price * quantity;
}

let totalPrice = calculateTotal(25, 5);
console.log(totalPrice); // Output: 125
```

‚úÖ
```
// Calculates the total cost by multiplying the price per item with the quantity
function calculateTotal(price, quantity) {
    return price * quantity;
}

// Example usage: Calculates the total price for 5 items at $25 each by multiplying the price
// per item ($25) with the quantity (5), and stores the result in the totalPrice variable.
let totalPrice = calculateTotal(25, 5);
console.log(totalPrice); // Output: 125
```

# Better Documentation - STAR Method

- The STAR method is typically used for answering interview questions, and applying this structure to your project overviews can be highly effective. 
- By organizing your projects using the Situation, Task, Action, Result format, your portfolio essentially speaks for you, conducting a virtual interview with potential employers even in your absence. 
- This approach ensures that employers can clearly understand the value and impact of your work, even without direct interaction.
- Remember, the results don't have to be ground breaking, anything that showcases your abilities in data science/machine learning, even "**learning**" counts as an important result.

# Project Structure

* **One** person from each team must host the primary Git repository. Other team members should clone that repository to work on it.

* There is no hard requirement for the folder structure of your project, but best practices should be followed.

# Working as a Team

The following two weeks will fly by quickly! How will you ensure that you can accomplish everything you need to as a team in this timeframe?

---

## Working as a Team

1. **Clear objectives and milestones**. Milestones should be set working backward from the final project goal and deadline.

2. **Accountability**. Every action item should have someone assigned. (Of course, the assigned person can change if workloads become unbalanced.)

3. **Communication of roadblocks**. It is just as important to communicate roadblocks and failures as successes. The faster problems are identified, the faster they can be addressed.

---

## Working as a Team

4. **Tracking**. Tracking your tasks is necessary to objectively assess your progress as a team. The data-driven mindset applies here too! If you fall behind, update your plan accordingly. 

5. **Documentation**. Team members should be able to understand and continue each others' work where necessary.

# Daily "Standups"

* Each day, a member of the DSI instructional team will help guide you through a "standup".

* This is a common practice in industry, where project teams have quick meetings each day to align on priorities, and to resolve blockers. The goal is not to compete for who did the most work, it is to make sure the entire team is working as effectively and efficiently as possible.

* Standups should take no more than 10 minutes!

---

# Daily "Standups"

* Each team member should describe:
    * What did you work on yesterday?
    * What will you be working on today?
    * Are you unsure about any of your tasks?
    * Are you blocked by anything?


<!-- 
Standups are not intended to see who has done the most work or who is slacking. They are a collaborative way to ensure that all team members know who is working on what, and whether anyone is stuck on their task and needs help. They are also extremely helpful in identifying blockers that may not be obvious. DSI team should emphasize the collaborative aspect of this and not put anyone on the spot. Learning should also be considered as a "task".
